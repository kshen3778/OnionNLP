<br>
<br>
OnionNLP was built for language learners who wish to simplify articles for easier reading when learning a new language. 
<br>
Our NLP algorithms perform extractive text summarization and clustering to find the most important sentences in the article.
<br>
Users can adjust the level of summarization.
<br>
<br>
List of things todo:
- More robust text preprocessing to extract sentences
- Neural coreference resolution
- Text simplification (turn more difficult words into simpler versions, or rewrite sentences to be simpler)
- Abstractive text summarization (similar to text simplication)

Currently supports articles in: English, Chinese
